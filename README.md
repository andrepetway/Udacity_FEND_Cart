Shopping Cart Functionality Capstone Project
Welcome to the Shopping Cart Capstone Project! In this project, weâ€™ll be creating the core functionality for a storefront application. The visual design of the storefront and the necessary JavaScript code to connect your work to that visual have already been set up.

Getting Started
There are two ways you can work locally on this project:

Work within the src folder:
Ignore all the excess files and strictly focus on the code within the src directory.
This approach is recommended if you prefer a minimal setup.
Leverage the live server and tests:
To take advantage of the live server and Jest tests, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
Check if Node.js is already installed by running the following command in your terminal:
node -v
If Node.js is not installed, you can download it from Nodejs.org (select the LTS version).
Change your working directory to the projectâ€™s root folder (the starter folder in this repository).
cd /path/to/your/project/starter

Install the necessary dependencies:
npm install
This will create a node_modules folder.
Project Highlights
Code Structure
The project follows a modular structure within the src folder.
Key components (such as product listings, cart functionality, and checkout) are organized into separate files for maintainability.
Functionality
Users can add products to their shopping cart.
Cart items persist across page reloads using local storage.
Quantity adjustments (increment/decrement) are supported.
The project demonstrates solid JavaScript fundamentals.
Code Quality
Clean, well-commented code.
Consistent naming conventions.
Proper separation of concerns.
